- Because fitbit doesn't support multiline input, you have to convert it to a comma-separated list by pasting it on this tool [https://convert.town/replace-new-lines-with-commas](https://convert.town/replace-new-lines-with-commas)

- Then you can use the comma-separated list
Q: I am getting blank screen with only the checkbox
- This is a [known issue](https://github.com/xmile1/fitbit-mylist/issues/1) that happens when you have more than 30 items in a list.
